# maud\_extras

This crate contains various bits and pieces that can be used in Maud templates.

To use an item from this crate, simply copy-and-paste the code into your project. Depending on `maud_extras` directly is discouraged, since (a) it often receives breaking changes, and (b) it's unlikely that you'll need everything.
